# In this example, the DQNAgent class has methods for remembering experiences, choosing actions, and training the model using replay.
# The remember method saves experiences in the agent's memory, the act method uses an epsilon-greedy policy to choose actions,
# and the replay method samples from the memory and trains the model using the experiences.
# The neural network architecture of the model is defined in the _build_model method,
# which is a simple feedforward neural network with two hidden layers and an output layer that corresponds to the action size.

# This is just one example of how to implement a DQN and it can be modified as per the requirement of the problem.
